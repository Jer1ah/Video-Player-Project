           <span class="1">Now that we've looked at the architecture
of the internet, let's see how you might</span>
           <span class="2">connect your personal devices to
the internet inside your house.</span>
           <span class="3">Well there are many ways to
connect to the internet, and</span>
           <span class="mrg-btm 4">most often people connect wirelessly.</span>
